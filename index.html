                              <p>The Rosetta Stone, from an official decree of the priests to the material for building a castle in the city of Rosetta, to war booty and is the main reason for discovering the ancient Egyptian language and finally the most important museum piece in the British Museum. Rosetta Stone is made from black granite or granodiorite that came from quarries in southern Aswan "Elephantine island". Rosetta Stone dates to 196 BC, and that was during the reign of King Ptolemy V (205 BC - 180 BC). Official edicts of priests were written on stones such as the Rosetta Stone. When the priests of Memphis wrote the decree to explain their support for the king and prepared several copies and distributed them to the temples of Egypt, what made the Rosetta Stone different from others is that it consisted of three texts, the ancient Greek, the Demotic and the hieroglyphic.</p>

                                <p>The stone was found while the French forces were building a fortress for them on the coast in the city of Rashid. It is probably that the stone was used as a building material during the Mamluk era. It was discovered by the French officer Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier Bouchard (1772-1832) and he realized its importance for noticing the different texts from each other. The Rosetta Stone became a war booty because it was handed over to Britain by France. This was done when the British forces entered Egypt in 1801, and the French army surrendered after some disputes between them. The Alexandria Treaty of 1801 was concluded, and Britain handed over the Rosetta Stone and many other antiquities. They were deported on board the French warship to England. And then the stone was copied, whether it was printed copies in some form, or to stone copies, and they were sent to France and England at different times.</p>

                                <p> Beginning with lithographs in Paris, a Latin and French translation of the Greek text was published in 1803 by Hubert Pascal Amilhon (1730-1811). And then Anthony Isaac Silvestre de Sassi (1758 - 1838) succeeded in discovering five names from the central part of the stone, which is the demotic. As for the hieroglyphics, the first contributor to it was Thomas Young from 1814, and he was able to discover the name of one of the kings recorded on the stone. He also collected the similarities between hieroglyphic and demotic, which exceeded 80 similarities. He published his famous long article "Egypt" in 1819. From Young's correspondence with Champollion in 1814, Champollion completed the tasks of deciphering the stone. However, he used several sources to broaden his view of this language. In his lecture on September 27, 1822, he recognized the alphabet in hieroglyphs to his audiences. On the same day, he published his famous book "Lettre √† M. Dacier". The Grammar and Dictionary of the Egyptian Language that he worked on it, was published after his death in 1832. From 1802, the stone was displayed in the Society of Antiquities in London for a while, and then at the end of the year, it was placed in the British Museum and only came out twice. The first was forced out during the First World War for fear of damage, so it was placed underground at a depth of 15 meters for two years. And the second time was his exit in 1972 to the Louvre for one month only to display it next to Champollion's Letter for the 150th anniversary of it.</p>

                    <p>The importance of decolonizing archaeological research that still carries the marks of the colonial effort is central to the ethical viewpoint of restoration.<br>
                         The concept of restitution involves not only tangible goods or property, but also considering human feelings, thoughts, and beliefs. It is important to start<br>
                          emphasizing Indigenous and minority claims for authority over land and cultural heritage by considering the perspectives of disenfranchised communities,<br>
                           Indigenous Peoples, minorities, historically and politically marginalized groups. This is also relevant in terms of having a responsibility to those who should<br>
                            be given back their cultural heritage rights. Restitution is only one aspect; on the other hand, there is a critical period of cultural recovery, which includes<br>
                             restoring cultural pride and confidence. It is a sort of re-empowerment that involves the development of intercultural discourse and the formation of new<br> 
                             forms of cultural interactions. It is critical to approach cultural objects from a postcolonial, post-dictatorial perspective, and to recognize that cultural discourse<br>
                              requires two parties. </p>

                    <p>The Rosetta stone belongs to the sphere of public property of Egypt as the treaty of Alexandria tells us that the antiquities shall be considered as public property<br>
                         or at the disposal of the generals of the combined army which was composed of Ottoman and British generals. The problem is that by article 16 of the treaty the<br>
                          antiquities which include Rosetta Stone are not public property because they are cultural property according to Customary law. Also, there were no apparent<br>
                           documents saying that the Ottoman generals were signing up their own right of antiquities to the British. the treaty says that the antiquities shall be at the disposal<br>
                            of the generals of the combined army which was dismantled when the British troops left Egypt which means that the antiquities should be considered as public<br>
                             property as the treaty dictates. </p>

                    <p>Here in Egypt, according to Western ideology, we are unconcerned about our antiquities. This concept arose from orientalism, which they used as a pretext to smuggle our antiques.<br>
                         This stereotype was passed down through a variety of mediums, including books, epics, social depictions of social classes (Blair 2014), politics, conventions, and traditions. Egypt is a <br>
                         country that has been impacted by colonialism and orientalism. After Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion (1790‚Äì1832) revealed his achievement in hieroglyphic decipherment of the<br>rosetta stone, 
                          many antiques traders flocked to Egypt (Reid 2002, Page 24). It looked as though archaeologists and European countries were competing to acquire the most exquisite<br>
                           artefacts. Their argument was that Egyptians are unconcerned about their antiquities, and that it is thus preferable to conserve them in foreign countries and museums. Egypt was known<br> 
                           as the "country of treasures" Europeans at the time. Actually, France conquered Egypt for military reasons in order to dominate the Indian commerce routes through Egypt, not to free Egypt <br> 
                           from Ottoman tyranny and institute social and economic change. Muhamed Ali, an Ottoman ruler, controlled Egypt and supported the French consul Bernardino Drovetti. Egyptians werenot<br> 
                           given the opportunity to control their own country and determine what to do with their heritage, and antiquities. This section details some of the antiquities mishaps that have occurred in <br>
                           numerous international museums, demonstrating the failure of preservation of Egyptian, and non-Egyptian artefacts. . </p>

                    <p>Heritage is the entrenched heritage that we inherit from the past, live in now, and will pass down to future generations. Tangible objects such as temples and relics such as the pyramids<br>
                         and the Rosetta Stone serve as realms of intangible cultural heritage. Traditions and oral manifestations, including language; performing arts; social activities, rituals, festive occasions;<br>
                          relevant knowledge, and practices are all examples of intangible heritage. Culture and the destiny of contemporary civilization are both dependent on heritage. Heritage is the criterion<br>
                           by which civilizations' traditions and identities are judged, as well as a significant means of passing down experiences, skills, and information across generations. It fosters a feeling of <br>
                           personal and community identity, which aids in the maintenance of social and territorial cohesiveness. This also creates new challenges to maintain. Identity is the undeniable legacy of <br> 
                           your civilization's history and past. Intangible heritage is equally important to identify to build your personality. Being aware of your heritage and your rights, which makes it a person difficult<br>
                            to influence the people who want to hide your identity, is a waste of your rights. Especially when you come from a country that faces tough challenges like war and poverty. It also opens your<br>
                             mind to other cultures and makes you a more tolerant person. The Rosetta Stone is a piece of Egyptian material culture. It is a unique piece of art and antiquities inscribed with hieroglyphic,<br>
                              demotic, and Greek inscriptions. It was the key to unlocking the hieroglyphic puzzle. The Rosetta Stone is named after the city of Rosetta, where it was discovered. In a naval battle with the<br>
                               French, the English forces were able to take the stone and ship it to Britain without permission in 1801. The evidence that the Rosetta Stone is the king of the Egyptians is that it is one of the<br>
                                documents that prove the eligibility of the Egyptians in the Rosetta Stone, the Treaty of Alexandria that was signed in 1802, which The French surrendered to the stone. The English and the<br>
                                 Ottomans mentioned in Article 16 of this treaty the confiscation of all the artifacts that the French acquired in Egypt, and there is a comment on the same article written in the treaty that mentions<br>
                                  leaving personal property to the French but confiscating public property. This confirms that the Rosetta Stone is the public property of the Egyptians. Because of its historical importance in helping<br>
                                   to decipher hieroglyphs, the stone has become an important part of Egyptian cultural identity. Without it, the civilization of Egypt would remain a mystery and we would not know anything about it<br>
                                    because we are unable to interpret the writings. The Egyptians owned this stone as public property, and to repair it, there must be widespread popular support. The human experience, which helps<br>
                                     to develop an identity between antiquities and humans and generate a kind of connection, is an important justification for repairing the Rosetta Stone. If the Rushdie Stone in the British Museum<br>
                                      helped them form an identity because of their visit to the museum and contact with the Rosetta Stone, then the piece should be returned to Egypt so that future generations can shape the abyss.<br>
                                       The number of stolen treasures that the British Museum will not relinquish is endless. Egypt has requested the return of the Rosetta Stone, and Easter Island has requested the return of the Moai<br>
                                        head statue. Even Greece, a European Union member, wants the museum to return the Parthenon marbles, which are known as the "Elgin marbles". Iraq's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also confirmed<br>
                                         the repatriation of antiquities from the British Museum in London, following the successful return of Iraqi antiques confiscated in the United Kingdom. </p>
